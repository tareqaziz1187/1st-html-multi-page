    <hr>
    <h3>Cats, like any other pets, may display signs that they desire companionship or social interaction. While cats are known for their independent nature, they can still enjoy and benefit from human or other animal company. Here are some common signs that a cat may want companionship:</h3>
    <br>
<h4>Purring and Nuzzling: When a cat is content and seeking companionship, they may purr, rub against you, or nuzzle your hand or face. This is a clear sign of affection and a desire for interaction.</h4>
<h4>Following You Around: If your cat follows you from room to room, it's often a sign that they want to be near you and spend time together.</h4>
<h4>Kneading: Cats often knead with their paws (pushing them in and out against a soft surface) when they're happy and looking for attention. Kneading is a sign of comfort and contentment.</h4>
<h4>Vocalization: Some cats are more vocal when they want companionship. They may meow or chirp to get your attention or engage you in interaction.</h4>
<h4>Cuddling: If your cat initiates cuddling, snuggling, or sleeping on or near you, it's a strong indication that they enjoy your company and want to be close.</h4>
